QUESTION 1

The repaired ForwardElimination algorithm on page 210 of Levitin 
doesn't provide a solution for the given problem because it doesn't 
implement partial pivoting, so it doesn't implement the easiest way 
to solve the problem. 
BetterForwardElimination does implement partial pivoting, so there 
is no danger of running into an error where the computer automatically
rounds the values and creates an issue. 

QUESTION 2

BetterForwardElimination fails to provide a solution to this equation
because it does not easily lend itself to creating an upper triangle 
in the matrix.
